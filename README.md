# Budget App

This repository contains a minimal mobile application built with Expo and React Native. The app now lets you record income and expenses with custom categories alongside the existing planning, analytics and receipt scanning tabs.

To run the mobile app:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

Expo CLI is required to run the project.

## Features

- Record income and expenses with categories
- Default categories include **Дім**, **Продукти**, **Одяг** and **Зарплата**
- Create your own categories directly from the home screen
